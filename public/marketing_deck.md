# Pillar: Construction Management Evolved
---
## 1. The Challenge: Why Construction is Hard
Contractors today face a "Triad of Chaos":
*   **Fragmented Data**: Spreadsheets for expenses, emails for communication, and mental notes for inventory. Nothing talks to anything else.
*   **Client Anxiety**: Clients feel in the dark about where their money is going, leading to mistrust and constant "status update" calls.
*   **Financial Blindspots**: Without real-time tracking, profit margins bleed out through unbilled change orders, lost tools, and forgotten material costs.
